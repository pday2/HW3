TSP

https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html has some more data files and solutions
the _d.txt files have a distance matrix than can be copied into excel and saved as csv
the _s.txt files have a minimum solution so we can check how we're doing.
It would be nice to find some bigger ones.
